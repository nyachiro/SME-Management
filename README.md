Project Outline: Full Stack SME Management System Using React and 
Spring Boot 
Note: An SME (Small and Medium-sized Enterprise) refers to small-scale businesses such as retail shops 
or service providers. This system aims to streamline daily operations and enhance business insights for 
such enterprises. 
Context 
We are developing a Single Vendor SME Management Software to simplify and automate operations 
within small retail environments. The system will consist of five integrated modules: 
 Inventory Management (with product categorization) 
 Suppliers 
 Point of Sale (POS) 
 Customer Management 
 Reports and Financials 

Objective 
Design and implement a modular, user-friendly, and responsive full-stack management system that 
enables store owners to oversee and control key business functions from a centralized interface. 
Module Specifications 
1. Inventory Module 
 Display products categorized by type with details such as name, quantity, price, and category. 
 Enable full CRUD operations. 
 Support real-time stock updates upon sales completion.

Submodules: 
 Expired Products: Automatically flag expired items and restrict sales. 
 Low Stock Alerts: Notify users when inventory levels fall below a defined threshold. 
3. Point of Sale (POS) Module 
 Provide an intuitive interface for adding items to a cart, viewing totals, and processing sales. 
On checkout: 
 Automatically reduce inventory based on sold items. 
 Record transaction details: date, items sold, and total amount. 
 Generate and print/download a customer receipt. 
4. Suppliers Module 
 Link products to specific suppliers. 
 View all suppliers and their associated products. 
 Perform full CRUD operations on suppliers and their records. 
5. Customers Module 
 Maintain a searchable, updatable database of customer records based on completed purchases. 
6. Reports and Financials Module 
Generate critical reports to support data-driven decision-making. 
Financial Reports will include: 
a. Income Statements 
 Record of sales and purchases 
 Calculation of net profit or loss over a defined period 
b. Cash Flow Statements 
Integration of: 
 Mpesa statements 
 Cash transactions 
 Bank transactions 
c. Statements of Financial Position 
 Overview of business health through: 
o Current assets (e.g., cash, inventory) 
o Fixed assets (e.g., equipment) 
o Liabilities (e.g., debts, payables) 
o Summary profit and loss reports 
Other Report Types: 
 Inventory/stock reports 
 Transaction summaries 
 Supplier performance reports 
Authentication & Security 
The system will include full authentication and authorization features: 
 User Registration and Login using JWT tokens 
 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with roles such as Admin, Cashier, and Manager 
 Session management with token refresh support 
 Route protection on both frontend and backend 
 Account recovery and password reset functionalities 
Design Expectations 
 Frontend: 
o Built using React and Tailwind CSS 
o Modular and component-based 
o Fully responsive and mobile-friendly 
o Intuitive, clean, and visually appealing design 
Backend Requirements 
 Implemented using Spring Boot following REST API architecture 
 Adherence to standard Java coding practices and design patterns (MVC, Singleton, Repository, 
Service) 
 Core functionalities: 
o CRUD operations for all modules 
o Real-time inventory updates during POS checkout 
o Supplier-product relationship management 
o Comprehensive transaction logging and report generation
